# 🌸 Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates a basic supervised learning approach using **Logistic Regression** to classify flower species from the well-known **Iris dataset**.

### 🧪 What’s Included
- Uses scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset
- Applies standardization for preprocessing
- Trains a logistic regression model for multiclass classification
- Evaluates model accuracy and visualizes results with a confusion matrix

### ▶️ How to Run
