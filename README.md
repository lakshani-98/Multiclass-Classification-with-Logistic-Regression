# 🌸 Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates a basic supervised learning approach using **Logistic Regression** to classify flower species from the well-known **Iris dataset**.

### 🧪 What’s Included
- Uses scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset
- Applies standardization for preprocessing
- Trains a logistic regression model for multiclass classification
- Evaluates model accuracy and visualizes results with a confusion matrix

### ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-logistic-regression.git
cd iris-logistic-regression

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script:
```bash
python iris_logistic_regression.py


###🛠 Dependencies
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

###📌 Output
Accuracy and classification report printed to console
Confusion matrix displayed as a heatmap
