# ðŸŒ¸ Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates a basic supervised learning approach using **Logistic Regression** to classify flower species from the well-known **Iris dataset**.

### ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Included
- Uses scikit-learnâ€™s built-in Iris dataset
- Applies standardization for preprocessing
- Trains a logistic regression model for multiclass classification
- Evaluates model accuracy and visualizes results with a confusion matrix

###ðŸ›  Dependencies
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

###ðŸ“Œ Output
Accuracy and classification report printed to console
Confusion matrix displayed as a heatmap
